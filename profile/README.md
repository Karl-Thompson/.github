# Welcome to KARL THOMPSON

Welcome aboard **KARL THOMPSON**, where we don’t just build software — we build *everything* (and sometimes accidentally summon the black cube). This is the brain centre for all things brilliant, bizarre, and borderline absurd: every idea, every line of code, every pixel starts right here.

## Our Mission (Because Reality is Overrated)

We’re not just coding; we’re creating the digital glue that will stick the *entire universe* together—or at least confuse it enough to work. If you’re a pioneer who dreams bigger than your coffee cup and weirder than your socks, this is your playground. Join us, and let’s make history — or something hilariously weird.

## Getting Started

Dive into the code, poke around the repos, learn the ropes (and the keyboard shortcuts). Your ideas and contributions keep this beautiful chaos running. So buckle up, put on your tinfoil hat, and let’s build something legendary… or at least absurdly awesome.

Thanks for joining **KARL THOMPSON** — where the future is coded today, and sanity is optional.

**KARL THOMPSON WILL TAKE OVER ALL.  
Not just software... EVERYTHING.**

*P.S. If you break something, just blame the black cube. It’s definitely its fault.*
